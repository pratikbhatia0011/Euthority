# Euthority
Applied NLP on EU legal corpus.

Code from my job(6 months) as a research assistant at the KU Leuven - Faculty of Law. 

The code files are from the early iterations and hence messy. This code was used to benchmark performance of simple transformer based models on the highly imbalanced Eurlex data.
